## 🔄 What Remains (Final Steps)

### Immediate Next Step: npm 2FA Setup
**Status:** In Progress  
**Issue:** npm requires two-factor authentication for publishing

**Current Situation:**
- User enabled 2FA on npm website
- CLI still shows 2FA as disabled (sync issue)
- Started CLI 2FA setup process: `npm profile enable-2fa auth-and-writes`
- Process interrupted, waiting for completion

### Final Publishing Steps (Once 2FA is Complete)
1. **Complete 2FA setup** (in progress)
2. **Publish to npm:** `npm publish --otp=YOUR_CODE`
3. **Verify publication:** Test installation and functionality
4. **Create GitHub release:** Tag and release notes (optional)

## 🛠️ Commands to Resume

### When Ready to Complete Publishing

**Navigate to library directory:**
```bash
cd /Users/ospyn/Work/PlayGround/react-native-auth-client
```

**Complete 2FA setup (if needed):**
```bash
npm profile enable-2fa auth-and-writes
# Follow prompts: enter password, scan QR code, enter OTP
```

**Publish to npm:**
```bash
npm publish --otp=YOUR_6_DIGIT_CODE
```

**Verify publication:**
```bash
npm view react-native-auth-client
```

**Test installation:**
